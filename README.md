# Basic Question
This is from a React interview question I have seen it is meant to be used in a 45min to 1 hour interview. 

Build a Multiplication table app in React
It should look roughly like below
* A user can click on the upper bar and the side bar to increase or decrease numbers The banners can scroll infinitely and only display five items. 
* Each square can accept an input. If the number is correct the square is green, otherwise red. The last guess is remembered
* The squres all store the last guess by a user and remember their color whether on or off the screen.

* Allow the user to double click to toggle between their answer and their last guess. 
* Allow a user to create a profile that is saved on a server along with a summary of incorrect and correct guesses.
